# the-guide
WordPress Plugin  

Explains to your site visitors how to use it.   
Like [Bootstrap Tour](https://bootstraptour.com/) but special for WordPress and easier to use (and more raw...).

Version: alpha 0.1

If you want to test the plugin, download the RELEASE archive from here https://github.com/vladlu/the-guide/releases, then go to Plugins > Add New on your WordPress site, click Upload Plugin button and select the archive.
