# About
WordPress Plugin.

Explains to your site visitors how to use it.   
Similiar to [Bootstrap Tour](https://bootstraptour.com/) but you don't need to know programming to use it.

# Usage  
  
It's in alpha at the moment, so I don't recommend to use it on production yet.


If you want to test the plugin, download the RELEASE archive from [here](https://github.com/vladlu/the-guide/releases), then go to Plugins > Add New in the dashboard of your WordPress website, click Upload Plugin button and select the archive.
